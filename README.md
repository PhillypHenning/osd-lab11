# Seneca Open Source Labs 

This is a repo to satisfy the various requirements of the lab work we have been given in the Seneca OSD 600 course, this ranges from Continous Integration with Travis to adding and understanding Contribution licenses.

This project checks to see if the onLoad() trigger is called again if a img elements source changes to the same source. 

## Getting Started
